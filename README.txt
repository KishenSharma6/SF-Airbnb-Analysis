Ownership
Who owns the most number of Airbnb properties in SF? Which hosts are the most popular(meaning, who has the most rented listings total)?
	- Which of these owners are renting out the entire home/apartment properties?
	- What kinds of properties are these and how do they compare to other hosts
	- Are these hosts also Super Hosts?

Hosts that only offer long-term rentals(rentals >=28 nights), how do their prices compare to that of the local San Francisco rent? Is Airbnb a possible, more affordable alternative to renting in San Francisco?
